The project is for Unsupervised Image Clustering. We introduce a novel architecture that uses VLMs to generate pseudo classes to enhance the clustering and classification performance in unsupervised setting.

The repository is structured in 3 folders each for one dataset - 
  1. CIFAR-10
  2. MNIST
  3. STL-10

Each folder contains 5 files - 
  1. A dataset processor notebook
  2. A KMeans clustering notebook
  3. A DBSCAN clustering notebook
  4. A STAMPClustering notebook
